# Training with USACO problems
## Usage
Download the testit file, it's a scrip which tells you your verdict
Modify the variable { path, file } to what you want
path means where your 1.in, 1.out, 2.int, 2.out.... is located
file means the binary file of you cpp file

Since some old usaco testcases are in format of I.1, O.2, I.2, O.2.... 
Execute the { convert file name } script first

Stuff to customize :
  1. $path in testit
  2. $file in testit
  3. (optional) $max_run_time in testit
  4. $path in convert name
